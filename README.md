# Mission-to-Mars
## Purpose:
The purpose of the repository is to hold my Mars's images.  I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of the images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web application to display the data and alter the design of the web application to hold those images.
## Files:
1.  Deliverable One:  Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
2.  Deliverable Two:  Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Iamges and Titles
3.  Deliverable Three:  Add Bootstrap 3 Components
